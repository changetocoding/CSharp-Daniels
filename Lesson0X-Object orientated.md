## Objects Orientate languages 101:
- **Abstraction** - cell phone/car: interact with few buttons but stuff under hood is hiden from you.
- **Encapsulation** - privacy: dont want boss to know gone on holiday. But simple as bank balance. ETP: Client is basically one big encapsulation of data so interact through ui. Imagine anyone just writing to db
- **Inheritance** - Parent. Children inherit it
- **Polymorphism** - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/polymorphism. virtual methods. subclass implements in own way.
