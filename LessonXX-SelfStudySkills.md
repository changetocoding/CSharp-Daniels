# Self Learn Skills

You are coder. You will get stuck. It happens with alarming frequency. Have no fear

Sources in order
1. Stackoverflow. The search on stackoverflow is not great so I recommend using Google site search and searching stackoverflow (In the search box, enter site:https://stackoverflow.com with your search term.)
2. Microsoft documentation: This used to be bad but it has gotten great over time due to the effort they've put into it.
3. Tutorials. If can find a tutorial then you have hit the jackpot. Alternatively you can find one that does something similar to what you want to do. Follow it step by step and do it exactly how they do. Then think what can I take from this and reuse. If you try to just jump in and apply it to your code, you might miss an important step that makes it all work.

4. Google search

**Never just copy code. At the very least create a new test project and try it out in there. Or a unit test. Only when you understand it enough do you use it.**

What to do when you get an error?

1. Debug to where the error is happening. Have a look at the variables: Maybe something is not set up properly
2. Google that error. Copy the full error message (minus the bits that are from your code and search it). Normally someone has had the same error
